In the previous section, the callback was called on each integer candidate solution. This sector will describe the use of the callback even on the fractional solution. 
The aim is to save computational time by adding new SECs that are probably common in the decision tree. 

The procedure defined in this phase is the same in section \ref{chapter:callback}, except that this callback is applied in the continuous relaxation of the problem.
To implement this kind of operation, I used an external library called Concorde \cite{concorde}. This library is written in ANSI C and it is one of the most powerful tools on the market: it can solve really large instances of the TSP problem to the optimal solution.\\
When the callback is called, I use the library mentioned above to compute which SEC I require to exclude the fractional solution from the decision tree.
