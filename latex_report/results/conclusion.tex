Among all the exact algorithms there is no doubt that the best performing one is the B\&C method, which reached the optimal solution in the shortest amount of time. Given a sufficient time limit, it should be able to solve larger instances with enough efficiency.

The use of a compact model is infeasible since the effort to compute an optimal solution is enormous and surely not worth it. However in this category, the best performing one is the GG model because it delivers consistently an optimal solution.

By all the matheuristic approaches the best-performing one was the Soft-Fixing, which brings the best solution most of the time. The Hard-Fixing method is still usable though because the solutions obtained from it are not too far away from the best ones.

The best metaheuristic approach is the VNS, which always provides the better solution. The use of the Soft-Fixing method is possible even with a higher number of nodes but - given a short amount of time - the solver hardly reaches a feasible solution.
